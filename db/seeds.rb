Before he can celebrate though, he falls to the ground.</p><p>In the blackness of space far above all this, the Guardians of the Globe make it to the command center of the ship where the Martians are waiting. They thank and congratulate the team but demand that they leave the astronaut behind to be executed. The Guardians refuse and are forced to flee in a stolen Martian ship. Unfortunately for the Guardians, they are unable to use the weapons on the ship, which becomes a problem when other Martian ships get launched from the mother ship and start to attack. Since they can't attack, Invincible leaves the ship and takes on the others on his own. When he returns to his ship he gets nothing but praise from his teammates. Then he and Atom Eve talk about a kiss they recently shared. </p><p>Back on Earth, Mark visits Amber and finds her with another guy. She hasn't cheated on him while he's been gone but she likes the guy he sees her with. Mark learns this from peeking into the window and makes a decision. He flies around the building and walks up to Amber's room just as the guy leaves. He talks to Amber and after a long, one-sided conversation, Mark and Amber break up. The decision is mutual, Amber was going to say the same things Mark had if he hadn't said them first. She will pursue the guy she met in his absence and Mark will go after Atom Eve.</p><p>Mark goes to see Rex-Splode, the last surviving member of the team that went to stop the Lizard League. Rex complains about Invincible getting a parade while his mission had to be hidden, but afterwards he said he wasn't seriously mad.</p><p>At his home that night, Rus Livingston, the rescued astronaut, coughs up some Sequids and they crawl over his face and body. As soon as they fully control his body they say (to no one in particular) that it's only a matter of time before they take over the Earth.</p>", "cv_id" => 109271, "image" => "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/308/119109-17993-109271-1-invincible.jpg", "issue_number" => 41.0, "name" => "Issue #41", "site_detail_url" => "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-41/4000-109271/", "store_date" => "2007-05-09"})

The answers to all these questions and even more questions piled on top of them – in this issue of Invincible.</i>  <br /> <b><br />SPOILERS</b><br /> <br />The story begins with a new character Universa making her way to Earth. Kirkman describes her as a warrior queen who has traveled countless miles to the planet earth, and will not stop until she gets what she has come for as her planet is in grave danger. Next, we see Rus Livingston fully possessed by Sequids reeking havoc. The Sequid invasion has begun.<br /> Mark &amp; Eve are discussing what happened last issue (It’s a major spoiler, I won’t spoil it for people just beginning the series) just then Eve receives a call that they are needed. When Mark, and Eve arrive on the scene Universa is attacking a Nucear power plant. She has a special kind of staff that wields the power of two light spectrums and turns them into one blast thus creating an unstoppable power. Invincible commences the battle with her, and later is partly defeated evidently leaving Eve to help fight Universa while he recovers. Unfortunately Eve is still having trouble with her powers.<br /> The Guardians of the Globe led by Brit go to stop the Sequid threat. They create a type of barrier, and appear to have everything handled. Off panel we return to Invincible’s battle with Universa. Mark steals her staff, only to be electrocuted by its fail safe Invincible appears to be defeated until Eve now powerless (per-say) leaves her unconscious with a left hook. Seconds later Cecil arrives and asks for Mark’s help against the Sequid Invasion. Mark assumes that they have the situation handled. The issue ends with a splash page in which Rus Livingston has defeated the Guardian of the Globe.", "cv_id" => 189593, "image" => "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/38919/1071696-invincible_69.jpg", "issue_number" => 69.0, "name" => "Issue #69", "site_detail_url" => "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-69/4000-189593/", "store_date" => "2009-12-23"})

They are unsure as to what or who has brought them to this place. They introduce themselves to each other. They then realize they are not alone. Across the way another construct has appeared and has gathered and it houses twelve villains of Earth, plus Galactus. The heroes are unsure; if all the villains are in the other construct, then what is Magneto doing in theirs.</p><p>The villains are wondering the same information in the other construct. After they introduce themselves to each other, they see a galaxy destroyed in front of them, and a planet is created from pieces of other planets. The villains begin to bicker with each other and a fight breaks out. Ultron tries to defeat them all and is knocked into Galactus. They are all amazed that Galactus simply drains the energy from Ultron. Galactus then goes back to staring away at the stars.</p><p>Suddenly, a bright light appears in space and a voice announces who has summoned them all, the Beyonder. He tells them he can do anything imaginable and that he orders them to battle each other, and the winning side will receive whatever they want. Galactus refuses to obey him and tries to fly towards the light because he senses it has much energy, which he is immensely hungry for. Doctor Doom follows Galactus and when they get close enough the light diminishes and they are thrown back. Then, the constructs are sent to a nearby planet and dispersed among two separate places on the planet. The heroes are then transported to the face of the planet. There they again question why Magneto is on their \"side\". They argue and this causes Magneto to \"fly\" away. They then decide Captain America will be the leader of the band of heroes.</p><p>Meanwhile, Galactus and Doctor Doom are seen on the planet surface as well. Galactus is unconscious as Doctor Doom explores the planet and finds a fortress. Inside he finds the other villains. They are trying to band together and defeat the heroes. Doctor Doom talks to them about stealing the immense power of the Beyonder, but is disgusted at their simple minds and takes off in a vehicle to seek out counsel with Mister Fantastic. Kang uses the fortress' weapons and shoots down Doom's vehicle. The heroes see it go down and try to help him. Doctor Doom attacks after Captain America says to Doom that he can just tell him and then flees. The heroes then turn around and see the villains all gathered and starting their attack.</p>", "cv_id" => 57504, "image" => "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/117763/2407772-marvelsuperheroessecretwars01.jpg", "issue_number" => 1.0, "name" => "The War Begins", "site_detail_url" => "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/marvel-super-heroes-secret-wars-1-the-war-begins/4000-57504/", "store_date" => "1984-01-25"})

His homeworld is disintegrated, but suddenly the energy is ripped away from him and streams toward Doombase. Captain Marvel flies there at lightspeed to investigate. She sees Doom in a machine, absorbing Galactus' energy, and tells the heroes via Professor X's telepathy.</p><p>Doom gets up and is startled by the new awareness and powers he has gained. He tries to accept the new limitlessness of omniscience and omnipotence. He notices Captain Marvel and freezes her in place. When the telepathic link is cut off, the heroes get in a ship and fly there. On the trip, the X-Men and other heroes argue over the role of Magneto and mutants.</p><p>Doom surveys the scene: he sees that the Beyonder's portal is still open, but is his prize now important now that he has Galactus' power? Or, does the Beyonder now sit as the one worthy challenge left for Doom? When Doom followed Galactus into the Beyond-realm in the first issue, his armor analyzed the Beyonder's energies; he now uses that information to make a new weapon against the Beyonder, hidden in his armor's chestplate.</p><p>The heroes arrive, but Doom has left. Klaw, now reduced to just a head after having his body turned into Doom's machine, explains where Doom went. The planet is shocked by a mighty tremor as Doom attacks the Beyonder. The heroes consider trying to revive Galactus as their only hope against such powerful foes. As they check around the planet, Colossus sees that Zsaji has been hurt, and tells Johnny Storm, who doesn't care due to his concern over a hurt Reed Richards. This enrages the jealous Colossus, but the fallout from Doom's attack forestalls any further action on his part.</p><p>The battle between Doom and the Beyonder sends out enormous energies into our universe, almost snuffing out Battleworld's sun. Doom is starting to lose. He sends a hologram down to the heroes, asking for their power. Magneto almost agrees, but hesitates. The other heroes knock him down, and Doom's hologram disappears. Doom is now helpless and the Beyonder begins to vivisect him. Even in the extreme pain of this procedure, Doom's will is unstoppable. He reaches toward his chestplate.</p><p>The heroes release the villains from their cells as the base falls apart. Captain America and Wolverine, who had argued in the ship in the last issue, now come to a position of mutual respect over each other's bravery and initiative.</p><p>Suddenly, an enormous figure in the shape of Dr. Doom appears on the planet.

He wants to talk. The villains, released from their cells, watch, unsure of what's going on. Titania's will is crushed, after being beaten by Spider-Man. The Molecule Man, however, is angry, feeling that Doom has betrayed them, and he rips up an enormous section of the planet's crust, separating them from the others. He prepares to attack Doom, but instead Doom open's Reece's mind, allowing him to see that he has been subconsciously limiting himself. He always thought he could only control inorganic molecules, but in fact he can control all matter and energy. By removing the block, and erasing his self-doubt, self-hate, and fear, the Molecule Man now becomes the second most powerful being in the universe. He collects all the other villains, telling them that he is their new leader, and they all fly away to Volcana's old apartment in the suburb of Denver that was made into part of Battleworld. Reece puts a shield around the city and flies it into space.</p><p>The heroes fly down to the ruins of the villains' old base to regroup. Colossus leaves to find out what happened to Zsaji. A glowing light awakens the Hulk and makes him start prowling the corridors. He runs into Spider-Woman, and the light transfers to her. She is looking for Klaw, but then another, brighter light stops her. The other heroes come in, and she tells then that Doom came in, reassembled Klaw, and took him away, leaving a message scrawled in the wall, summoning them to the \"Tower of Doom\"--a two-hundred-mile-high edifice which suddenly appears nearby.</p><p>Klaw and Doom talk; Doom explains that he cannot sleep, or his power will go wild.</p><p>Colossus finds Zsaji and they are happy together. The other X-Men, realizing where he has gone, are unsure about what this means, since he used to be in a relationship with Kitty Pryde.</p><p>The heroes go to the Tower of Doom. He offers to set aright the problems he has caused, and revives Kang and sends him back to his own time. He says that Galactus has been found and helped by Nova. He offers the heroes all a boon, but they say no and leave. They realize Spider-Woman isn't with them, and Captain America goes back to find her. Doom has Klaw look for her, and he talks with Captain America. He says his next plan is to free his mother's soul from Mephisto. Meanwhile, Spider-Woman catches Klaw in a psychic web and the glowing light transfers from her to him. Captain American leaves with Spider-Woman.</p><p>All the heroes reconvene to discuss the situation. Professor X recalls Colossus to meet with them as well. Captain America explains that he thinks they cannot trust Doom, even though he seems beneficent. Everyone votes to attack Doom. Colossus is last, since he has just now found peace with Zsaji. When he says yes, they are immediately destroyed by a bolt from the sky.</p>", "cv_id" => 57514, "image" => "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/117763/2407786-marvelsuperheroessecretwars11.jpg", "issue_number" => 11.0, "name" => "...And Dust to Dust!", "site_detail_url" => "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/marvel-super-heroes-secret-wars-11-and-dust-to-dus/4000-57514/", "store_date" => nil})

Klaw asks what Doom did, and starts to add doubt to Doom's ability to control his powers.</p><p>Meanwhile, as the villains fly their suburb of Denver back home, the Enchantress uses a water elemental to find out what is happening on Battleworld. She fears the recent developments. The villains are all stir-crazy and fighting among themselves. Dr. Octopus confronts the Molecule Man, saying that even at lightspeed it will take forever to get home. But Reece shows him that he will teleport them home soon. Reece also shows Octopus that he has recreated the galaxy that the Beyonder destroyed in issue 1. Octopus can't believe such power exists, and Reece has to restrain him. At the same time, the Enchantress is going to use the energy in Volcana's soul to get back to Asgard. Volcana said she would pay any price to the Enchantress in issue 7 if she sent her to Reece, and now the Enchantress is collecting that debt. Reece intervenes and saves Volcana. The Enchantress teleports away to Battleworld, taking the Lizard with her. She seemingly kills the Lizard and tries to use his energy to get back to Asgard.</p><p>Doom almost falls asleep; he is very tired. Klaw once again plays on his fears. He explains how the heroes could have survived: Zsaji could put them in medical stasis, then revive Colossus, dying herself. He could then revive Reed Richards using the alien healing machines, who then revives the others. All this, he says, because Doom used a dramatic bolt from the blue rather than just disintegrating them. And, perhaps, Doom subconsciously used his power to help all this along. Doom is angry, he says it can't be true.</p><p>Then...Thor's hammer blasts through the walls. Doom's power starts to run amok. His mind is too unbalanced to use his power effectively, so Klaw asks for some, so he can fight the heroes. Klaw creates an army of monsters, and recreates Ultron, and attacks the now-alive heroes. It's a battle royale. The Thing turns back to his rock form, and realizes he can now consciously control his transformations. The Hulk dents Ultron's adamantium body, and the Wasp gets inside and blows him up. Captain America runs past Klaw to go inside; Klaw is seen to be happy with this development. Captain America confronts Doom, and Doom disintegrates him. But then Captain America is revived--by Doom's unconscious self-doubt, or some other force? He continues to kill him, only to see him resurrected. It turns out this is all Klaw's doing. The glowing light, which was originally in the Hulk, and then Spider-Woman, and then Klaw, now leaves Klaw and goes toward Doom. The light was the Beyonder, and he now reclaims his power from Doom. Doom and Klaw disappear in a flash of light.</p><p>The heroes reconvene back at the base. Colossus mourns for Zsaji. Spider-Man finds out that he used the wrong costume-making machine, but doesn't realize the ramifications yet. The Hulk continues to lose his intelligence. The Lizard shows up in his human form as Curt Conners. Then the dragon Lockheed reappears. They realize that when Doom lost his power, the energy spread all over the planet, creating an atmosphere where wishes can come true. Captain America brings together all the pieces of his shield, and they are reformed into the shield's original shape.</p><p>Reed Richards finds a way to teleport them all home. At first Colossus doesn't want to come, but eventually he agrees. Another dragon, similar to Lockheed, goes with them as well. The Thing says he's going to stay, since he can control his transformations, and the She-Hulk takes his place in the Fantastic Four. Everyone else leaves, leaving Ben Grimm alone on the planet.</p><p>The end of this epic story has great ramifications throughout the Marvel Universe. Plot threads from this issue continue in Thing #11, Fantastic Four #265, Amazing Spider-Man #252, Avengers #243, and Secret Wars II #1.</p>", "cv_id" => 57515, "image" => "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/117763/2407787-marvelsuperheroessecretwars12.jpg", "issue_number" => 12.0, "name" => "Nothing to Fear", "site_detail_url" => "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/marvel-super-heroes-secret-wars-12-nothing-to-fear/4000-57515/", "store_date" => nil})
